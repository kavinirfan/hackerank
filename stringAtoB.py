"""Ayush is working on a strange algorithm where he wants to convert a string from A to B, both the strings of equal length N. Below are the rules which can be performed to convert a string. String A and B are of equal length Both of them are in lower case Choose a subset X from the string A, between the index 1 and N. Let ‘s’ be the letter which alphabetically comes before all other letters in the subset. Let ‘s’ be called the ‘smallest element’ in the subset. Replace all the elements of subset with the letter ‘s’ Find the minimum number of moves which is required to perform the conversion. If it is not possible to convert the string from A to b then return -1 Let us try to understand it with and examples Suppose there are 2 strings A = abcab B = aabab Operation 1: Now we have chosen a subset S, let us say we have taken index 2,3,5 from A Then the subset S becomes [bcb] Next, we have to choose the smallest element , 6041 here, which is b here in b & c Next, we have to replace all the other elements in subset with this element. So ‘b’ with replace everything in [bcb]. which becomes [bbb]. Now we will place all the respective elements back to their respective index. This will update the original string as [abbab] Operation 2: Original string [abbab] Now we have chosen a subset S, let say we have taken a index 1,2,4 from A Then the subset become [aba] Next, we have to choose the smallest element, which is here in a & b. Next, we have to replace the smallest with all the other elements in subset. So ‘a’ will replace everything in [aba] Now we will place all the respective elements back to their respective index. This will update the original string as [aabab] This is exactly same as String B Hence it is possible to convert string A to B, with 2 operations. So, the answer is 2.

Input Format

First Input-Accept value of Integer, N.
Second Input-Accept value of string, A (Next Line)
Third Input-Accept value of string, B(Next Line)
Additional messages in output will cause the failure of test cases
Constraints

1<=N<=1000
N integer
Only lower case letters of the English alphabet
Length of A,B = N
Output Format

The output is an integer as per above logic. (Check the output in Example 1, Example 21

Sample Input 0

de
cd
Sample Output 0

-1
Explanation 0

In the above example we can clearly see that there is an alphabet in A which is completely different from B. hence it is not possible to convert A to B
So the answer is -1
Sample Input 1

4
abab
abaa
Sample Output 1

1
Explanation 1

Operation 1:
Now we have chosen a subset S, let say we have taken index 3,4 from A
then the Subset S becomes [ab]
Next, we have to choose the smallest element, which is a here in a & b
Next, we have to replace the smallest with all the other elements in subset. So ‘a’ will replace everything in [abl, which becomes [aa]
Now we will place all the respective elements back to their respective index. This will update the original string as [abaa]
This is exactly same as String B
Hence it is possible to convert string A to B. with 1 operation. So, the answer is 1
